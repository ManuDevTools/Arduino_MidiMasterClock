# MidiMasterClock
Clock made in arduino to synchronize the tempo of synthesizers. Designed for Pocket Operator (and compatible)

Midi Master Clock, is a project based on https://github.com/ejlabs/arduino-midi-sync. 

In this case, it has been modified to be used with 8-segment displays, through multiplexing with a shift register, making use of interrupts with the Arduino Timer2.

This project has three parts.

- Electronic assembly.
- Microcontroller programming.
- 3D design of the cover.
